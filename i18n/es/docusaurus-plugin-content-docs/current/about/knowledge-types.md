# Types of knowledge in the project

In any project, you can distinguish certain types of knowledge

- **Fundamental knowledge**  
  Knowledge that practically does not change over time.  
  *Algorithms, computer science, the mechanisms of the YAP and its API, etc.*

- **Technology stack**  
  Knowledge about the set of technical solutions used in the project.  
  *Programming languages, frameworks, libraries, etc.*

- **Project knowledge**  
  Knowledge that is applicable exclusively within the framework of the current project.  
  *They are not transferred to the outside world in any way and, having left this project, you can forget about this knowledge.*

  *Naturally, this also works in the opposite direction â€” to add a new person to the current project, you need to train him **a certain minimum amount of this project knowledge** - without which a new participant will not be able to perform useful work*

**Feature-Sliced Design** aims to take on more responsibility from "project knowledge" so that people can get onboarded into teams and projects faster

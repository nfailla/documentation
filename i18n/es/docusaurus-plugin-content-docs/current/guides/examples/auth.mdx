# Auth

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Every application has business logic related **with the current authorized user.**

> Usually such an entity is called `Viewer` / `Principle` / `Session` - but within the framework of the article, we will focus on `viewer`, but it all depends on your project and team

Also, this is one of the illustrative examples when a business entity generates business features, then pages, and even business processes

Let's look at them in more detail below with examples

:::note

1. The names of the directories inside the segments (ui, model) may differ from project to project

    *The methodology does not regulate this level of nesting in any way yet*

2. It should also be understood that the examples below are abstract and synthetic, and are formed to demonstrate only the concepts of the methodology

    *FSD does not regulate the best practices of a particular data-fetcher or state-manager*


:::

## Entities

**The business entity of the user**

- Represents the most atomic abstraction for design
- Here the authorization context is formed, which is then usually relied on by all the overlying layers of the application

:::info

It should be understood that often there is a public "external" user (`entities/user`) in the application, and there is an authorized "internal" user (`entities/viewer`)

*Do not forget to take this difference into account when designing architecture and logic*

:::

### Examples

```sh
# Segments can be both files and directories
|
├── entities/viewer              # Layer: Business entities
|         |                      #     Slice: Current user
|         ├── ui/                #      Segment: UI-logic (components)
|         ├── lib/               #      Segment: Infrastructure-logic (helpers/utils)
|         ├── model/             #      Segment: Business Logic
|         └── index.ts           #      [Public API Declaration]
|   ...           
```

- `entities/viewer` - the entity of the current user *(Session / Principle)*
- `entities/user` - the essence of public user *(not necessarily associated with the current)*
  - *Depending on the complexity of your application - you can use the `user` for naming the current user*
  - *But it can cause serious problems when/if I have to separate the logic of a normal user and current, who came into the system*

### `index.ts`

The usual [Public API of the module][refs-public-api]

*Largely repeats the API declaration for the layers described below*

```ts title=entities/user/ui/index.ts
export { ViewerCard } from "./card";
export { ViewerAvatar } from "./avatar";
...
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="redux" label="Redux" default>

In redux, the [redux-ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) approach is generally accepted when its units (selectors/actions/...) they lie side by side and are clearly decomposed

But explicit decomposition is not required

```ts title=entities/user/model/index.ts
export * as selectors from "./selectors";
export * as events from "./events";
export * as stores from "./stores";
...
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="effector" label="Effector">

The effector model will most often consist of a single file - because it is customary to store all units side by side there

If the units in the model can be schematically divided into several submodels, then [you can explicitly do this](https://github.com/feature-sliced/examples/pull/1#discussion_r654841332) denote in the Public API

```ts title=entities/user/model/index.ts
export * as submodel1 from "./submodel1"
export * as submodel2 from "./submodel2"
...
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

```ts title=entities/user/index.ts
export * from "./ui"
export * as viewerModel from "./model";
```

### `ui`

It may contain components that are not related to a specific page/feature, but directly to the user's entity

```tsx title=entities/user/ui/card/index.tsx
import { Card } from "shared/ui/card";

// It is considered a good practice not to link ui components from entitites directly to the model
// So that it can be used not only for the current model,
// But also for externally received props

export type UserCardProps = {
    data: User;
    className?: string;
    // And other card-props
};

export const UserCard = ({ data, ... }: UserCardProps) => {
    return (
        <Card 
            title={data.fullName}
            description={data.bio}
            ...
        />
    )
}
```

### `model`

At this level, the entity of the current user is usually created, with the re-export of hooks/contracts/selectors for use by the overlying layers

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="redux" label="Redux" default>

```ts
// entities/viewer/model/selectors.ts
export const useViewer = () => {
    return useSelector((store) => store.entities.userSlice);
}
export const useAuth = () => {
    const viewer = useViewer();
    return !!viewer
}
// entities/viewer/model/store.ts
export const userSlice = createSlice(...)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="effector" label="Effector">

```ts
// entities/viewer/model/index.ts
export const $viewer = createStore(...);
export const $isAuth = $viewer.map((viewer) => !!viewer);
// **/**/ui.tsx
const viewer = useStore($viewer);
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Also, other logic can be implemented here

- `updateUserDetails`
- `logoutUser`
- ...

## Features

**Features tied to the current user**

- Uses business entities (often `entities/viewer`) and shared resources in the implementation
- Features may not be directly related to the viewer, but they can use its context when implementing logic

### Examples

```sh
# Segments can be both files and directories
|
├── features/auth                # Layer: Business features
|        |                       #    Slice Group: The structural group "User authorization"
|        ├── by-phone/           #      Slice: Feature "Authorization by phone"
|        |     ├── ui/           #         Segment: UI-logic (components)
|        |     ├── lib/          #         Segment: Infrastructure-logic (helpers/utils)
|        |     ├── model/        #         Segment: Business Logic
|        |     └── index.ts      #         [Public API Declaration]
|        |
|        ├── by-oauth/           #      Slice: Feature "Authorization by an external resource"
|   ...           
```

- `features/auth/{by-phone, by-oauth, logout ...}` - **structural** group of authorization features *(by phone, by external resource, logout,...)*
- `features/wallet/{add-funds,...}` - **structural** group of features for working with the user's internal account *(adding funds to the account,...)*

### `ui`

- Authorization by an external resource

```tsx title=features/auth/by-oauth/ui.tsx
import { viewerModel } from "entities/viewer";

export const AuthByOAuth = () => {
    return (
        <OAuth
            domain={...}
            scope={...}
            ...
            // for redux, you additionally need dispatch
            onSuccess={(user) => viewerModel.setUser(user)}
        />
    )
}
```

- Using the user's context in features

```tsx title=features/wallet/ui.tsx
import { viewerModel } from "entities/viewer";

export const Wallet = () => {
    const viewer = viewerModel.useViewer();
    const { moneyCount } = viewer;
    
    ...
}
```

- Using the viewer components

```tsx title=features/header/ui.tsx
import { ViewerAvatar } from "entities/viewer";
...
export const Header = () => {
    ...
    return (
        <Layout.Header>
            ...
            <ViewerAvatar
                onClick={...}
                onLogout={...}
                ...
            />
        </Layout.Header>
    )
}
```

## Pages

**Pages related to the current user in one way or another**

- They can both directly affect the functionality of the viewer
- And use it indirectly (including its context / features)

### Examples

```sh
# Segments can be both files and directories
|
├── pages/viewer                 # Layer: Application pages
|        |                       #    Slice Group: The "Current User" structural group
|        ├── profile/            #     Slice: The viewer profile page
|        |     ├── ui.tsx        #         Segment: UI-logic (components)
|        |     ├── lib.ts        #         Segment: Infrastructure-logic (helpers/utils)
|        |     ├── model.ts      #         Segment: Business Logic
|        |     └── index.ts      #         [Public API Declaration]
|        |
|        ├── settings/           #     Slice: The viewer account settings page
|   ...           
```

- `pages/viewer/profile` - the user's LC page
- `pages/viewer/settings` - user account settings page
- `pages/user` - the user's page (not necessarily the current one)
- `pages/auth/{sign-in, sign-up, reset}` **structural** group of authorization pages *(login / registration / password recovery)*

### `ui`

- Using the viewer components and *viewer-based* features on the pages

```tsx title=pages/user/ui.tsx
import { Wallet } from "features/wallet";
import { ViewerCard } from "entities/viewer";
...
export const UserPage = () => {
    ...
    return (
        <Layout>
            <Header
                extra={<Wallet.AddFunds />}
            />
            ...
            <ViewerCard />
        </Layout>
    )
}
```

- Using the viewer model

```tsx title=pages/some/ui.tsx
import { viewerModel } from "entities/viewer";
...
export const SomePage = () => {
    ...
    return (
        <Layout>
            ...
            <Settings onSave={(payload) => viewerModel.saveChanges(payload)} />
        </Layout>
    )
}
```

## Processes

**Business processes affecting the current user**

- Affects user cases that permeate the pages of the system
- **The process layer is optional**, and is usually used *only when the logic grows in pages* and you need *separate context management* on several pages at once

### Examples

```sh
# Segments can be both files and directories
|
├── processes                    # Layer: Business processes
|        ├── auth/               #     Slice: User authorization process
|        |     ├── lib.ts        #         Segment: Infrastructure-logic (helpers/utils)
|        |     ├── model.ts      #         Segment: Business Logic
|        |     └── index.ts      #         [Public API Declaration]
|        |
|        ├── quick-tour/         #     Slice: The process of onboarding a new user
|   ...           
```

- `processes/auth` - the business process of user authorization
- `processes/quick-tour` - a business process for familiarizing the user with the system *(~ UserOnboard)*

## App

**Initialization of user account data**

- There is usually a check on whether the user **was already logged in** before he entered the service
  - **If yes** - the provider replenishes the user's context for further use in the system
  - **If not** - the authorization process is started or the context of the viewer is changed so that the authorization page takes the necessary actions

### Examples

```sh
# The `app` structure is unique for each project and is not regulated by the methodology
|
├── app/providers                # Layer: Initializing the application (HOCs providers)
|        ├── withAuth.tsx        #    HOC: Initializing the authorization context
|        |   ...                 #
|   ...           
```

- `app/providers/withAuth` - HOC for user authorization
  - Used **only at the top level, as a provider** with logic initialization, to which only _**app**-layer_
- **Not to be confused with the `useViewer` hook**, which is accessed by all other layers *(processes / pages / features)*

## Conclusions

As we can see in the examples above - **all business logic begins to be built from a single entity, and can spread to the very top layer.**

Therefore, you need to be able to **correctly allocate the scope of the module's influence**, and depending on this, choose the appropriate layer for the location of the logic.

*Thus, we will get the most supported, readable and reused code.*
